# Git/Github as version control systems

## First of all what is a version control system? ü§î
Version control is a system that contains all versions of your repository tracking all changes in its lifecycle. It also plays a huge part in the integration among the work of team members, adding ease to the collaboration process on projects and so on. for Git and GitHub, they work by saving new changes by file diffs tracking what changes happened every time you interacted with the repo. 

### That's the main idea of a version control system but what's special about Git or GitHub.

### What's even the difference between Git and GitHub?

Let's tackle those questions one by one saying that Git runs on your local machine tracking all the changes occuring to your repo asking you if you want to save them to the repo or not, and having other features, like specializing a branch to mess up with the repo your way without having to face consequences on the main branch as you can always go back to the main branch the last stable point of your repo and revert all changes you made on this branch, more features are explained in detail in the resources provided, make sure to have a look at the documentation. Okay that's cool for Git what about GitHub? Okay let's say that you are working on a repo with your team, and each member of your team has his own personal machine. You don't want to waste time transfering files physically from a machine to another copying the .git file which has all the info tracked about your repo, you want an easier solution, something like cloud shared repo, and that's where GitHub shines bright. GitHub offers you the centralized version of you repo hosted on cloud, granting you and your fellow teammates the experience of working easily on the same repo at the same time without any worries about integration.

## Why do we need to learn version control for DevOps? ‚ôæÔ∏è
The main idea for DevOps is enhancing the development and operational process of a project and by that you need to make the integration between both of them as fast as possible, and for that to happen you need to get the changes the developers commit to the project up and running ASAP on the production environment leaving minimal downtime by automating processes and other details we are going to specify later.

Note that version control systems is now a necessity for developers to ease their job and to simplify development process. We -as DevOps engineers- can make use of that by tracking the new changes added to the main branch immediately after committing them and checking them by running tests that are already made for them automatically, and if they pass, they get merged and uploaded to the production environment immediately and this process is known as CI/CD workflow.
