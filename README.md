## About this repo ⚙️
Each topic contains a README.md file which contains an overview over the topic and should also contain learning resources for it. You will find code examples which should be commented and explained in detail.
## How can you best benefit from this repo? 📚
1- Take your time learning from the resources in the README or anywhere else

2- play around a little with the stuff you learned

3-  try solving the example first by yourself before checking the answer.
## Reminders 🧠
1- Take it easy. Don't rush it. Remember, Rome was not built in a day.

2- Focus on the basics first. i.e.: git, bash scripts, simple networking. `make sure to check this cool repo https://github.com/AbdallahSalah003/BashLab`

3- You will never know everything. Keep seeking knowledge all the way, that's what life's about anyway!

4- Choose discipline over motivation
